 // Function Name: kron
 //  Return Kronecker tensor product
 // Given matrix A (with n rows and p columns) and matrix B (with m rows and q columns), generate a matrix (with nm rows and pq columns) that denotes the tensor product of A and B
 // Calculating the kron
 inputMat1 = [ 1, 2; 3, 4;]
 inputMat2 = [2, 3; 4, 5;]
 result = armaMatFunc("kron",inputMat1,inputMat2)
